<h1>Workshop 3: JavaScript Events</h1>
<hr />
<p>In this exercise we will practice the use of BOM and the JavaScript events. Use the lecture-material as a reference guide side by side these exercises. It might also be a 
good idea to save the lines of code you write during the exercises for later use.</p>


<h2>Exercise 1</h2>
<p>&nbsp;Below you will see three buttons. Edit the source code and add an onClick-events to these buttons.</p>
<p>
  <button>Button 1</button>
  <button>Button 2</button>
  <button>Button 3</button>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Button 1 should open an alert-button, which will say "You clicked me!" </li>
  <li> When you see the button working, add the current date after the text by using the Date() -function. HINT. You can get spesific parts of the date by first creating a date 
object var pvm = new Date(). And then calling for methods such as pvm.getDate() and pvm.getHours() etc. See <a 
href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_date_methods.asp" /> this for details.</a>
</li>
  <li>Button 2 should call a function called showTable()". ShowTable function should output a simple HTML-table (below) to the page. Use document.write to print data. Feel 
free to modify the data on the table. </li>
HINT. You can print multiple lines using backticks:
<xmp>
var html = `
  <h1>
    <b>Some HTML here</b>
  </h1>
`;
</xmp>

<br>

<table id="example" class="display" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>Position</th>
                <th>Salary</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tfoot>
        </tfoot>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Tiger Nixon</td>
                <td>System Architect</td>
                <td>$320,800</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Garrett Winters</td>
                <td>Accountant</td>
                <td>$170,750</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Ashton Cox</td>
                <td>Junior Technical Author</td>
                <td>$86,000</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cedric Kelly</td>
                <td>Senior Javascript Developer</td>
                <td>$433,060</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Airi Satou</td>
                <td>Accountant</td>
                <td>$162,700</td>
            </tr>

        </tbody>
    </table>
    <br>

  <li>Button 3 should print out an HTML table (Name, Addrees, Country) using data from the following JavaScript array. HINT: Use looping to go through the array and print 
the data surrounded by HTML-tags to create the table.  </li>
<xmp>
var persons = ["Nyssa P. Skinner", "593-4241 Lacus, St.","Cape Verde", 
	       "Camilla F. Strickland","391-2150 Ac Rd.","Andorra",
	       "Reagan U. Andrews", "P.O. Box 472, 2271 Mauris Ave","Faroe Islands",
	       "Kelsey D. Clark", "P.O. Box 866, 7793 Aliquet Ave","Bulgaria"
];


</xmp>
</ul>

<h2>Exercise 2</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Add an&nbsp;onMouseOver event on the&nbsp;Heading "Exercise 2" of this page.&nbsp;It should&nbsp;fire when the users mouse is moved
over&nbsp;it. Output "Stepped over my a mouse!" on the console.</li>
  <li>Add another event, which will fire then the mouse leaves the Exercise 2 -heading. This time show an alert window to the user saying: "Bye bye mouse!"</li>
</ul>
  <h2>Exercise 3</h2>
<p>Below you will see a simple form.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add onfocus -event to the&nbsp;textarea below. When the user enters the textarea, it should show a text saying: "Please fill in the form with proper data.". You can try 
modifying the background color of the box as well. &nbsp;
</li>
  <li>Try to use onkeydown -event on the textarea. It should calculate the number of keypresses and output them on the screen. Could you think other smart ways to use it?
</li>
  <li>When the form button is clicked, check if the textarea is empty. Notify the user with appropriate message. HINT: You can access the Textarea using the following 
command:   <i>document.getElementById("textdata").value</i>. We will study the forms deeper in Workshops 4 and 5.</li>
</ul>
<form>
  <textarea id="textdata"></textarea><br>
    <button>Send me</button>
</form>
<h2>Exercise 4</h2>
So far you have hardcoded the events into HTML tags. Make a copy of your exercise file and try to add the events dynamically, without touching the HTML at all. This can be 
achieved using addEventListener() -function, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_eventlistener.asp"> see more here</a>.

<h2>Exercise 5</h2>

<div id="coordinates"></div>

<p>Add onMouseMove -event to the DIV-element above. When you move mouse over the DIV (rectangle) the program should output the coordinates of your pointer. Try first 
outputting to the console using console.log. <p>HINT. When the event occurs, call for a method showXY(event); Then in the actual method you can output data from the 
mouse event using event.clientX and event.clientY variables. Study the event object in the console  and what data you can find in it.</p>
<p> When the program is working, you can try outputting the text on the H2 element with an id "coords" the box</p> HINT: You need to use 
document.getElementById("coordinates").innerHTML to achieve this.

<H2>Exercise 6</h2>
<button>Get location</button> 
<button>Show location</button> 

<li>The first button should check <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_geolocation.asp">Geolocation</a> of the user, and output it to the console and to the 
page. Note: Some browsers might not allow you to do this. Try different browsers if you get errors.</li>
<li>
The second button should show your location on a Google Maps. You can see the map with a spesific location using the URL 
"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center="+latlon+"&zoom=14&size=400x300&sensor=false" where latlon is your latitude + longitute data separated by 
comma (,).
</li>
